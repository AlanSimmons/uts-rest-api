# uts-rest-api (alpha)
A repository of code samples in various languages that show how to use the UMLS Terminology Services REST API

For more information please see the UMLS REST API [technical documentation](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/home.html).

To run the Java samples, you can clone this repostiory and then import the pom.xml as an existing maven project.  Each java class can be run as a Junit4 test.

To run the perl clients, you'll need to install the JSON, URI, GET, LWP::UserAgent, and HTML::Form perl modules.
